entitled to the protection of all of the terms of this Agreement which exclude
or limit liability for any losses or damage. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>9. Collections and Deliveries</h3>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>In the event that the Relevant Carrier
is unable to collect the Consignment or any part thereof, the Relevant Carrier
will either leave details of the attempted Collection at the Relevant
Collection Point or update the tracking information on the website to show the
attempted collection. All re-bookings of collections must be made direct with 999
Parcel’s customer support team. Please note that any collection that has been
missed by fault of the customer may incur a surcharge that is payable by the
customer prior to the order being re-booked with the courier. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>If the goods are not ready for
collection by the Carrier at the place and time agreed, a charge for 'Nothing
to Collect' will be made. A surcharge of &pound;5.00 will be applied if there is
'Nothing to Collect'. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>For any of our Same Day
Collection/Delivery services - waiting tine will be charged in 1 minute
increments after the first 15 minutes at &pound;2 per minute. This is a charge that
the carriers levy on 999 Parcel and so it has to be passed on to the sender. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Dependant on the service and courier
selected they will make one attempt to deliver a Consignment during normal
working hours. If the relevant carrier cannot obtain a receipt at the relevant
delivery point it may attempt to deliver and obtain an appropriate receipt at
an address close to the relevant delivery point and, if successful, will leave
at the relevant delivery point details of the address at which delivery has
been effected. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>If the Consignment has not been
delivered, the Carrier will return it to their warehouses, after leaving at the
relevant delivery point a request for the consignee to contact the Carrier to
make alternative delivery arrangements. If no such contact is made within a
reasonable time-frame the Carrier will either retain the Consignment or return
the parcel and the customer will be liable for any additional charges that may
be incurred. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>The automated system books the collection
as per the customer's request. Please note that collection date &amp; time is
not guaranteed on any service. Collection will be made at anytime between
08:00-18:00 Monday-Friday (excluding Bank Holidays). Saturday collections are
available on most services at an extra cost. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>A receipt must always be obtained on
collection of your consignment from the carrier. No claim can be made if a
collection receipt has not been obtained as there is no proof that the carrier
has collected the parcel. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Please note that most of our services
require a Barcoded label &amp; Printed Address Label to be printed out and
attached to the parcel. Manual paperwork (including handwritten address labels)
must not be used. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>On the advised services the driver will
leave a Waybill document that you may have to complete with the 'to' and 'from'
address details. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>It is the customer's responsibility to
ensure that all the details are correctly completed and displayed on the
correct parcel and no claim or reduction will be made if the parcel is sent and
the details were incorrect or placed on the incorrect parcel. It is not the
driver's responsibility to check this information, so please ensure this is
checked before he leaves. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Shipments to and from remote areas
nationally and internationally on all services may be subject to delay and
possible service downgrade. No refund can be given in these circumstances. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>10. International Carriage &amp;
Customs</h3>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>In the case of services where the
Company is required to collect goods from or deliver goods to a country outside
the United Kingdom the Company's liability is governed by the relevant
provisions of the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of
Goods by Road as set out in the Schedule to the Carriage of Goods by Road Act
1965 (as such Schedule may be amended from time to time) (&quot;the CMR
Regulations&quot;) and in particular Articles 21 and onwards, which provisions
will be incorporated into this Agreement and will apply in place of any
inconsistent terms above written. A copy of such provisions will be supplied if
required at a charge of &pound;20 to cover administration fees. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Documents up to 1.5Kg do not need a
commercial invoice to any destination. These should be declared as zero value.
If an incorrect value is entered, 999 Parcel cannot be held responsible for any
charges that may apply. Consignment(s) that exceed the value of &pound;4,699 may be
delayed as they will require further documentation for clearance. TTK Express
do not advise sending any consignment over &pound;2500 as no additional Transit Cover
can be offered over this value. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>You are pre paying for the postage
charges of your consignment(s) only. 999 Parcel has no control over any customs
queries or charges that may arise. It is the Customers responsibility to check
whether there are taxes, duties or other customs charges for your consignment.
You can do this by speaking to the Consulate of the destination country. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>In the event of a parcel being returned
to the sender from outside the UK then the charge will be the appropriate
import rate for the consignment. This is likely to be higher than the price
paid to export the goods. The sender is also liable for this charge. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>11. Charges / Payment</h3>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) If you are not a business customer

jewellery, valuable antiques or plants or plant seeds or derivatives. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(d) Should you or the consignor
nevertheless (whether knowingly or unknowingly) drop off prohibited articles in
a parcel to the relevant collection point or cause us or our contractors to
handle prohibited articles otherwise than under special arrangements previously
made in writing, we shall be under no liability whatsoever in connection with
the parcel however arising and you shall be liable for any and all loss or
damage caused by, or in connection with the articles however arising and shall
indemnify us against all penalties, claims, damages, costs and expenses
whatsoever arising in connection therewith and the articles may be destroyed or
otherwise dealt with at our sole discretion or by any other person in whose
custody they may be at the relevant time. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(e) we reserve the right to reject a
parcel that contains a prohibited article. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>16. Surcharges</h3>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(a) International Surcharges </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>There are currently no international
surcharges. However, any change to this situation will be notified on this page
with at least 14 days’ notice. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) Fuel Surcharges </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>A fuel surcharge for contract parcel
products will be specified in the contract. A fuel surcharge of 3% is applied
on the product price after any discounts or commissions, and before VAT. We
will communicate any fuel surcharge rate changes 30 days in advance. Fuel
surcharges will not apply to non-contract business and consumer parcel
services. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17. Our liability</h3>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>YOUR ATTENTION IS DRAWN PARTICULARLY TO
THIS CLAUSE AND THE LIMITS OF OUR LIABILITY WITHIN IT. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.1 Where you deal with us as a
consumer, nothing within these terms and conditions shall be deemed to affect
your rights under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. For the avoidance of any
doubt, when you deal with us as a business the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977
is hereby excluded to the fullest extent legally possible and you are further
referred to additional terms relating to business clients set out below. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.2 Nothing in this Agreement shall
limit or exclude our liability for: </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(a) death or personal injury caused by
our negligence; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) fraud or fraudulent
misrepresentation. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.3 As a responsible business, we will
perform the Service(s) in a professional manner with the appropriate level of
skill and care. However, damage to a Consignment may still occur as a consequence
of our handling of it and in such circumstances, our liability shall be limited
as set out in these Terms and Conditions. The reasoning behind this limitation
of our liability is as follows: </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(a) The value of a Consignment and the
amount of potential loss to you that could arise if a Consignment is damaged or
lost is not something which we can easily ascertain but is something which is
better known to you. In many cases it cannot be known to us at all and can only
be known to you; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) The potential amount of loss that
might be caused or alleged to be caused to you is likely to be disproportionate
to the sum that we could reasonably be expected to charge you for providing the
Service(s) under this Agreement; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(c) It is not possible for us to obtain
cover which would give unlimited compensation for our full potential liability
to all of our customers and, even if it were, such cover would be much cheaper
if taken out by you (rather than us taking out such cover and passing the cost
on to you) and on that basis, it is more appropriate for you to take out such
cover, though you are able to purchase increased extra compensation from us for
your Consignment, during the ordering process; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(d) We wish to keep the costs of
providing the Service(s) to you as low as possible; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(e) In light of the above we wish to
limit our liability for any damage caused to you to levels which we consider
proportionate to our low charges for providing the Services. These amounts are
set out in clause 17.5; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(f) In these Terms and Conditions,
damage to you means any damage suffered by you (including any loss of, or
damage to, a Consignment and any other loss, whether or not known to you or us
or in either of our contemplation at the time of entering into this Agreement),
however it arises but only so long as it is caused by our negligence, breach of
duty or other wrongful act or omission (which includes any deliberately
wrongful act or omission) and any breach of any the terms of this Agreement, or
any terms implied by statute (where applicable); </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(g) We investigate all claims received
by us in a fair and speedy manner, but such investigations are more accurate
and are easier to perform soon after the loss or damage is alleged to have
incurred and on that basis, the timescales set out in this Agreement are
necessary to ensure that such investigations can be performed fairly. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>The Extent of our Liability </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.4 We shall only be liable for damage
or loss caused to you if it is caused by our negligence, breach of duty or
other wrongful act or omission, and only subject to the limitations set out
within this clause 10, 17, 19 and clause 20; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.5 We shall not be liable to you under
any circumstances for any direct or indirect loss (including, but not limited
to loss of profits, or loss of goodwill) or for any other special or indirect
losses, costs, damages, or claims which do not arise naturally as a result of
our negligence, breach of duty, or other wrongful act or omission. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.6 We shall not be liable to you: </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>a) under any circumstances where there
are any material discrepancies (meaning more than 10% difference) between the
declared dimensions and weights and the actual dimensions and weights. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>b) in any circumstances in respect of
the items on the Prohibited items; Special Provisions items and No Compensation
items lists, unless otherwise stated by us. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>The Limitation on the Amount of our
Liability </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.7 If we are liable to you for any
reason, we shall only be liable to you up to the amounts in the circumstances
which was written in clause 19. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.8 In order to ascertain the extent of
our liability above, we shall require proof of the value and weight of the
entire Consignment and any part or parts of it which make it up and you must
ensure that, prior to our collection of the Consignment, you have a record of
these. For the avoidance of any doubt, and without affecting clause 17.5, we
shall only be liable for the replacement value of the Consignment and not for
any sums that would amount to profit on the Consignment or applicable value added
tax (or like tax) on such profit. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.9 If a claim arises as a result of
damage to the whole or part of a Consignment and if we settle the claim for a
sum equal to or greater than the value of the Consignment, then we shall be
entitled to claim ownership of the Consignment and deal with it as we see fit.
For the avoidance of any doubt, we shall be responsible for the cost of
recovery of the Consignment. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.10 If you wish to combine a number of
discrete packages you must do this within an outer box or packaging fully
encompassing each discrete package. If you do not do this and any individual
discrete package(s) come apart in transit resulting in one or more of them
being lost, then once the remaining parcel(s) are signed for by the recipient,
you accept that you cannot make a claim for loss or partial loss of that
consignment. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Special Provisions </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.11 (a) We shall not, in any
circumstances, be liable to you for any damage caused arising directly or
indirectly as a result of any of the Excepted Risks. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) If at any time we are prevented or
delayed from starting, carrying out or completing any of the Services because
of a strike, lock out, labour dispute, weather conditions, traffic congestion,
mechanical breakdown or obstruction of any public or private road or highway or
any other cause beyond our control, you shall have no claim for damages against
us for any loss that you may suffer as a result PROVIDED that, where the delay
is caused by the mechanical breakdown of one of our vehicles, we shall use our
best endeavours to provide a replacement vehicle with the minimum delay
practicable. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(c) We shall not in any circumstances be
liable for any late delivery or missed delivery or failure to deliver caused by
or contributed to by any deficient or ambiguous labelling of a Consignment and
you agree to be responsible for ensuring that such labelling is clear and
unambiguous. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Your Default </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>17.12 If our performance of any of our
obligations under this Agreement is prevented or delayed by any act or omission
by you or failure by you to perform any relevant obligation (“Your Default”): </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(a) we shall (without limiting our other
rights or remedies) have the right to suspend performance of the Service(s)
until you remedy Your Default and, and we shall have the right to rely on Your
Default if Your Default prevents or delays our performance of any of our
obligations; </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) we shall not be liable for any costs
or losses that you may suffer that arising directly or indirectly from our
failure or delay to perform any of our obligations; and </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(c) you shall reimburse us on written
demand for any costs or losses sustained or incurred by us arising directly or
indirectly from Your Default. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>18. Customer's Obligations</h3>

required, and that you shall not cause us, to carry anything if it would be
illegal or unlawful for us to do so (either in the UK or any country to which a
Consignment is to be delivered). You agree that should you do this, you will
indemnify us against any losses and/or damage that we may suffer as a
consequence. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>18.3 We will not, without specific separate
written agreement, carry: livestock; liquids; perishable goods; gasses;
pyrotechnics; arms; ammunition; corrosive; toxic; flammable; explosive;
oxidising or radioactive materials. In addition we will not carry any items

you. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>18.5 You understand that: </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(a) All Consignments shall be accepted
at the Delivery Point and that the recipient shall give our driver an
appropriate receipt and you agree that this receipt shall be conclusive
evidence of delivery of the Consignment by us. This clause 18.5(a) shall not
apply where such receipt is obtained as a result of fraud, collusion or
dishonesty on the part of our driver. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>(b) If there is a strike by any
employees of yours, or the employees of any person receiving delivery, then you
agree that our representative shall not be asked to perform any additional
duties or any duties of a strike-breaking nature. </p>

<h3 style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>19. Damaged / Lost Claims</h3>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>The customer remains responsible for
ensuring packaging is adequate for transportation. All items must be packed in
a double walled box which is securely fastened with further padding surrounding
the item making the item unable to touch the sides of the cardboard box or move
whilst in transit. In addition the sender will be liable for any damages caused
in transit to other shipments or property resulting from sending a consignment
that is inadequately packaged.</p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Items not boxed or sufficiently packed
are excluded from our services and could be subject to delay / return / held
for collection by the customer. Such goods could also be discarded if: </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>- they are damaged to such an extent
such as smashed glass, or cause a concern in regards to health and safety
regulations. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>- if goods have been held for collection
by customer and the time limit advised has been exceeded. Please be aware in
such a circumstance, the customer will be aware that collection of said goods
must be arranged by a certain date or the goods may incur storage charges, and
finally discarded at a cost payable by the sender. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>In the event of claims for damage the
Customer shall provide to 999 Parcel within 3 calendar days of the delivery
being made photographs of internal / external packaging used and of the damaged
item; a quotation for repair costs and a proof of value for the damaged item
showing the item and the cost paid / sold for. In the event that a damaged item
cannot be repaired, the Customer must provide written proof of this from a
relevant specialist before 999parcel.com can consider the full claim amount. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>In order for a customer to make a claim
for a damaged parcel and / or contents - it is of paramount importance that the
parcel is signed for as 'DAMAGED' otherwise any claim for damage will be
refused. It is therefore the customers / recipients responsibility to check the
contents of the parcel upon delivery to ensure there is no damage. If the
recipient signs for a parcel in 'GOOD CONDITION' or 'UNCHECKED' then no claim
for damage will be accepted under any circumstances, regardless of any tracking
information entered or advise directly from the courier. It is the customer's
responsibility to inform the recipient of these terms and conditions also. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>A lost claim can only be processed once
the carrier has made extensive searches and deems the goods as lost. This
process can take up to 40 working days to be completed. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>The claims process is aimed to be
resolved within 28 working days of notification and all decisions are made at
the sole discretion of 999 Parcel and / or the relevant carrier. Please allow
though up to 60 working days for a resolution. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>The documents required to be submitted
with your claim are listed below: </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>Loss - Collection paperwork as left by
the driver at the point of collection, proof of value showing the item and the

be rejected), proof of loss from the receiver and signed advising no goods
received with them or any of their neighbours. </p>

<p style='mso-pagination:widow-orphan'>999 Parcel reserves the right to reject
or refuse any claim if any of the terms above have not been met. </p>
